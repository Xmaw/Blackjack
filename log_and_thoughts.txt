The idea of this project is to get a more in depth understanding about creating
python projects. I chose blackjack because it seems easy enough and I enjoy playing it.

The first step is to be able to get deck going. I have had a python script on my computer
that constructs a deck of cards. So I am going to build upon that script. 

I aim to integrate this blackjack program to a GUI for a more immersive experience.
However. I will start off by getting the logic and rules going before I am going to 
get the GUI going.

----PROBLEMS----
Problem encountered with the Window function. Since I use 'self.' for almost everything
I am not able to deal cards to the Dealer without the Dealears card will counted as
the Players sum of cards.
